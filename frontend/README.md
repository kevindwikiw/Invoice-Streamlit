# Invoice Streamlit Frontend

This folder bootstraps a Vite + React + TypeScript frontend to begin migrating
from the Streamlit UI. The stack uses TanStack Router for client-side routing.

## Getting started (Bun)

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

## Alternative (npm)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
